# Ray-Tracer
A fully functioning Ray Tracing program built from scratch in C++ by me. This project is a great example of the marriage of mathematics and progeramming. It required a working knowledge of linear algebra, C++, OOP and algorithms. It was a very satisfying project to work on as the results are very visual and speak for themselves. 

Sample outputs from the raytracer:
